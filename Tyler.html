                <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>The parents were extremely poor. The war destroyed their small house, and their family of four was forced to live on the streets. One day, mysterious beings arrived and offered a large sum of money for Tyler and his little sister. The parents believed it was the best option for their children and gave them away. (They were killed shortly after. The children never found out.)  

                    The buyers took the two to a factory specializing in weapons and special equipment. There, they had to work all day. Tyler befriended a girl who worked beside him after she reached out to him and held his hand. She helped them get through the day and meet their quotas, because anyone who disappointed the overseers was beaten. Tyler deeply admired the girl and was grateful for how well she cared for them, even though she was still just a child herself—about the same age as Tyler at the time.  
                    
                    Then, one day, his sister collapsed, coughing violently and gasping for air. The poisonous gases in the factory had made her gravely ill. That was the moment Tyler realized they had no choice but to escape—if they stayed, his little sister would die. The girl understood immediately and began planning their escape.  
                    
                    During their attempt, they were discovered. Magic bullets were fired at them. The girl was struck fatally, but Tyler only spared her a brief glance as she fell to the ground. Fear took over, and he ran, holding his sister in his arms. They were so close, just one last gate to the courtyard stood between them and freedom.  
                    
                    But when he finally stopped running, outside the walls, he looked down at the girl in his arms—and saw that she was no longer breathing. Tyler clenched his eyes shut, lay her on the ground and without looking back, he ran , running for as long as his legs would carry him until they finally gave out beneath him.  
                    
                    When he woke up, he was in the infirmary at the academy.  
                    
                    There, Juliana helped him adjust to his new life. After some time, Tyler asked her to go with him. And so, they left together.</p>
