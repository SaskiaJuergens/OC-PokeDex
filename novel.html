        <h2>Kapitel 1 - Pyjama Party</h2>
            <p>They tell stories about a forest that takes the life of anyone who dares to enter it.
            It seems to stretch on endlessly, and even in the bright light of day, no sunlight breaks through the tightly clustered treetops, ranging from birches to occasional redwoods.
            Only a single woman is said to have been brave, or perhaps foolish, enough to venture into this dark domain and come back out alive. Yet those who knew her barely recognized her upon her return.
            She had grown quiet, more withdrawn than ever, and never spoke of what she had experienced there.
            One day, however, driven by an invisible force, she broke her silence. She announced that she would enter the forest once again.
            Desperately, they tried to stop her, but she would not be dissuaded.
            She was never seen again. Her former fortune had likely run dry.
            This woman, once known as a magicologist and primary school teacher, was called Miss Lythra.
            In her memory and to honor her former victory, they began to call the dark forest “Lythra.”
            In the heart of this all-devouring dark forest lies, hidden in a clearing, an academy far removed from the outside world.
            The sun glimmers across lush gardens, bathing everything in warm light: fields full of garlic, potatoes, watermelons, and many other fruits, enough for hundreds of people.
            A small pavilion, entwined with wisteria blossoms and nestled between cherry and other fruit trees, creates a peaceful, almost magical mood.
            The large building, whose façade bears the name “Everdawn Academie” in ornate lettering, is partially overgrown with wild vines and creepers, a remnant of another world.
            It is a fairytale-like glade, cradled in the heart of a mysterious, dark forest. </p>

            <p> “Louann, would you please perform the spell for us?” the teacher asks sternly. All eyes turn to Louann,
            a girl with trusting, large eyes and hair glowing in gentle shades of pink and blue ombré.
            A pointed, blue horn sparkles on her forehead, marking her as a unicorn being.
            From her lower back grows a slender tail, its colors harmonizing with her hair.
            Louann, who had moments earlier been lost in thought at her desk, startles and awakens.
            Still half in her dream world, she rises somewhat uncertainly from her chair.
            She casts an embarrassed glance at her best friend Rebecca, who quickly hands her the opened spellbook and points with her mechanical finger to a specific incantation, a jumble of letter clusters that, to outsiders, appears as gibberish or a childlike fantasy language.
            Rebecca belongs to the robot class, but to Louann, she is just like everyone else in the room. </p>

            <p>The teacher is already standing in front of Louann, shaking her head disapprovingly.
            “You have just nicely demonstrated why it is especially important to stay attentive during class and not simply fall asleep,” she explains strictly. “Your pronunciation was flawed and your focus was everywhere except on the spell. That is why the orb was so small and unstable.
            It seems you are relying too heavily on your innate magical instinct. But that will not suffice.
            With advanced magic, a mistake can have far worse consequences than a little smoke and spark. Are we understood?”
            Louann pulls a face and absentmindedly remarks, “But I am a unicorn being. Shouldn’t magic come more easily to me?”
            No sooner have the words left her lips than the face of a classmate in the back row darkens.
            Mitsu, a tiger girl with long brown hair and orange fur marked with dark stripes, angrily crumples the page beneath her hand.
            Her tiger tail lashes back and forth in agitation as she glares at Louann.
            Sabrina, an angel being seated directly behind Mitsu, observes her clenched hand with a mischievous smile.
            “Even higher beings must learn much to avoid resting on the few advantages of their kind,” the teacher admonishes sharply. “Otherwise, they will be overtaken by those who work hard and continuously evolve.” She casts a sharp look at Louann. “Sit back down, Louann.”
            Louann slides back into her seat, her face flushed from the scolding.
            “RING!” The shrill bell pierces the tense silence.
            “Becci, help me!” Louann throws herself theatrically around Rebecca’s neck. “Casting magic is so hard! You have to pay attention to so many things, even though we are still practicing beginner spells.”
            With an unmoved expression, Rebecca frees herself from Louann’s grip and slowly turns toward her.
            “Our teacher has already provided a sufficient analysis of your weaknesses,” she says in a monotone voice. “Based on the data I collected from your failed attempt to create a light orb, there is nothing more I can add.”
            “But that alone doesn’t help me!” Louann whines, pouting. “Becci, you are my best friend and you can perform all the spells right away! You have to show me how to do it properly! Pleeeaase!”
            Rebecca looks forward again and finally stands. “If we find a suitable place to train, I will show you how to improve your mistakes,” she states calmly.
            Without another word, Rebecca walks toward the door. Louann skips after her with a beaming face.
            “Tsk.” Mitsu clicks her tongue in contempt. She had heard every word of the conversation and now looks at the crumpled page where the failed light orb spell still lingers.
            Suddenly, she hears the sound of a chair being pushed back. Without turning her head, her pupils drift to the right.
            There she sees Sabrina walking down the aisle between the rows of desks, also heading toward the door.
            With a scornful glance, Mitsu watches her from the corner of her eye, full of distrust and disdain.
            “Conceited brat,” she murmurs softly. </p>

            <p>In the break hall, the group of friends sits together: Rebecca, Louann, the mermaid Chloé, the deer being Dana, Tyler of the devil race, and the human Luke.
            Suddenly, Juliana, Tyler’s girlfriend, appears and greets the group with a cheerful “Hey, guys!”
            Louann, who lies limply with her chin on the table while Rebecca patiently explains the light spell in detail, lifts her gaze wearily.
            A small smile, livelier than before, flits across her face.
            “Hey, Juliana. So you’re really still going to class? Even though it’s your last week at the Academy.”
            Juliana smiles a little sheepishly and shrugs slightly.
            “Well, the knowledge I get here will surely still come in handy out there.”
            “Louann’s just jealous because she can’t skip class like you,” Tyler throws in, giving Juliana an encouraging grin. “She flubbed another spell today.”
            “That wasn’t even... you... I am not jealous!” Louann exclaims, lifting her head from the table in protest.
            Rebecca gently places her hand on Louann’s head and strokes her hair soothingly. Louann sighs softly and lets her face fall back onto the table.
            Dana and Luke, who had just been deep in their own conversation, look up as Louann’s loud outburst draws attention.
            Juliana laughs quietly and continues, “And since it’s my last week at the Academy, I thought we could do something together one last time this weekend. I would really love that.”
            “That sounds grea” Dana begins, but Louann bursts out excitedly, “Oh yes! We could have a pajama party in our secret hideout!”
            And so the pajama party for the weekend is planned.</p>

            <p>Even during the break, the group eagerly works out the details of their final evening together.
            One by one, they sneak into their tree hideout, concealed in the shadow of the dark forest.
            Louann is the first to reach the hideout: a towering redwood whose mighty trunk rises into the night sky.
            Skillfully, she climbs a few meters up the rough bark until a large hidden hole becomes visible.
            Carefully, she squeezes through, mindful not to damage any of the lights she is carrying.
            The narrow hole leads a few steps deeper before the tight passage opens into the heart of the tree: a surprisingly spacious cave furnished with mattresses and cushions.
            A cozy refuge, hidden within the old redwood.
            With a satisfied smile, Louann fastens the last string of lights.
            Colorful hues shine all around, dancing in gentle waves across the wooden walls and bathing the cave in warm, enchanting light.
            For a moment, Louann simply stands there, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.
            It feels like a small paradise, far away from the world out there. Shortly after, Luke appears, loaded with a huge bag of chips and a variety of other snacks.
            “I brought everything you need for a perfect pajama party: chips, popcorn, sweets... the whole package!” he announces with a grin, bowing dramatically.
            Chloé and Dana are already eagerly spreading pillows and blankets across the mattresses.
            The sleeping spots are generously arranged so everyone has enough space to stretch out and get comfortable.
            Tyler and Juliana follow, heavily burdened with two large crates of drinks.
            “Refreshments! A bit of everything,” Tyler calls out, setting the crates down.
            Juliana nods with a smile and places her crate aside before entering the hideout as well.
            Shortly after, Rebecca reaches the hideout.
            With a conjuring gesture, she stretches out her hand and, slightly strained, lifts it upward while maintaining a firm stance.
            One by one, the bottles float out of the crates through the hole in the tree.
            On the other side, Juliana and Louann stand ready to catch them.
            Once everyone has settled onto the many mattresses, the conversation gradually begins to flow.
            Rebecca sits a bit apart from the circle, a book in her hands, her brow slightly furrowed in concentration.
            Nonetheless, her quiet presence radiates calm and familiarity.
            Laughter fills the room.
            Drinking games and stories make the night pass in a flash.
            Everyone enjoys the moment as if the world outside their hideout had simply vanished for a while. </p>

            <p>Mitsu sits alone in their room, absentmindedly flipping through their slightly crumpled spellbook. Their eyes stop at an advanced spell on water manipulation.
            They glance at the water-filled cup sitting next to them on the table. Their gaze shifts back to the book as they try to mimic the illustrated hand movement, whispering the incantation. But the water remains still. Disappointed and frustrated, Mitsu slams their fist on the table, causing the cup to tip over. Water spills onto the floor.
            “Damn it...”
            Suddenly, there’s a knock at the door. Mitsu lifts their head, confused, and carefully steps over the puddle to open it.
            “What do you want?” they snap when they see Sabrina standing there.
            “You were a little loud, so I came to check on you!” Sabrina grins, though her eyes immediately fall on the puddle of water on the floor.
            “May I?” she asks, her eyes glowing with curiosity as she raises her hands and makes smooth, flowing gestures that mirror those from the spellbook. She speaks the incantation, and the water begins to lift slowly off the ground. It floats into the air as if pulled by invisible threads, then gently falls into the nearest flower vase. Mitsu watches, captivated, as the water streams into the vase. A grin spreads across Sabrina’s face.
            “Want me to teach you how to do it properly?” she asks with a friendly yet confident voice. Mitsu looks at her for a moment, then nods hesitantly, caught between reluctance and curiosity.
            “Alright, show me how you do it.” Sabrina smiles lightly and raises her hands again, as if accepting a challenge.
            “Now you show me how you’d do it.”</p>

            <p>At the tree hideout, the group has started a cheerful game of spin the bottle. Eventually, Juliana and Tyler step away from the group. They climb out of the cave, and as they descend, Tyler supports Juliana by holding her hand until she’s low enough for him to help her down. As he gently sets her on the ground, their eyes lock.
            Juliana glows with happiness as they stand close together under the old, massive tree.
            “How long have we been together now?” Tyler smiles.
            Juliana giggles softly and steps out of the embrace. She runs her hand over the rough bark, slowly circling the trunk until her fingers stop at a carved symbol. Tyler watches, delighted by her playfulness.
            Juliana gazes dreamily at the symbol – the letters “T + J” surrounded by a heart – as Tyler steps up behind her.
            Juliana turns her head to him.
            “It was right here that you kissed me for the first time six years ago. A year later, we carved our initials into the tree.”
            Tyler looks at her lovingly, wraps his arms around her, and gently kisses her shoulder. Juliana leans back into his protective arms and closes her eyes.
            After a moment of warmth and bliss, she opens her eyes and looks at the heart again. Slowly, her smile fades.
            </p>

            <p>“Nothing’s working,” Mitsu grumbles after several failed attempts to move the water. Sabrina grins at them playfully.
            “Maybe you need to understand how magic works before jumping into advanced spells.”
            Mitsu lowers their head humbly. Their ears droop in embarrassment. Sabrina smiles, a hint of pride in her expression.
            “Well, if you don’t want to start with basic magic and jump straight into object manipulation, I get it. Just materializing little objects is pretty boring anyway.
            I suppose you remember Louann’s failure in our last class. Focus is important. But all she tried to do was summon a light orb – for that, the right incantation is usually enough.
            But with advanced spells, focus and the right words aren’t enough anymore. Your body becomes the key to success. Got it?”
            Mitsu nods slowly. Sabrina lifts her head with pride and continues.
            “When you try to make something like water float or move, you need physical control. You need just the right amount of force to guide it. Too much or too little – and the spell fails.”
            Mitsu looks at the water again.
            “I have a lot of strength,” they say quietly.
            “I know. Your kind is naturally gifted with great strength. Unfortunately, that makes spellcasting more difficult,” Sabrina says with a sympathetic look – which quickly turns into a proud grin.
            “It’s going to take ages to teach you. But for a friend, I’m willing to put in the effort. What do you say?”
            Mitsu looks at her, then at the cup, then back again. They nod.
            “Then I’ll try to teach you as much as I can during breaks – whenever we find the time.”
            Sabrina twirls toward the door with model-like steps. With a quick
            “Good night,” she disappears from Mitsu’s room. </p>

            <p>“We should break up,” Juliana says suddenly, her eyes still fixed on the heart.
            Tyler takes a moment to register what she’s said. Then he replies,
            “But why? We could write letters, or I could...”
            “You’ll have to leave school too in a few years and leave this safe little clearing. You need to learn to stand on your own. I can’t always hold your hand. As beautiful as this time has been – it’s time to say goodbye.”
            “I don’t understand... what does that have to do with us? We could still see each other.”
            “Who knows if we’ll find each other again... or where I’ll be,” Juliana says sadly. She can’t bring herself to say it – her future, what probably awaits her.
            “Then I’ll come with you.”
            “That’s exactly the problem. You’ve already forgotten what it was like before you came here. Where you came from, who you had to leave behind... how cruel the world outside this clearing is.”
            Tyler looks at her, confused. She gives a weak smile.
            “I don’t blame you. You were still young and scared. It must have been hard. That’s why I could never leave you alone.
            You still mean a lot to me. But I’ve known for a long time that you’ve become too dependent.
            Now is finally the time I’m able to let you go.”</p>

            <p> Meanwhile, back in the tree hideout, the group is enjoying drinking games, their laughter echoing off the wooden walls. After the umpteenth time Chloé gushed about her oh-so-perfect Pyronus, Luke seizes a brief pause in her speech to change the subject.
            “Alright, Rebecca, now it’s your turn to tell a truth!” he says, grinning.
            “Hmm... what should we ask?” Louann frowns and sneaks a glance at Rebecca.
            “You know her best,” Dana says, leaning lightly against Chloé. Her face carries a dreamy smile and signs of sleepy drunkenness.
            “So you should come up with the question. Is there anything you still don’t know about her?”
            Rebecca remains calm, almost indifferent as always. Her sober gaze doesn’t get caught up in the group’s silliness. But Louann clearly feels challenged by Rebecca’s composure. She throws herself on her stomach and starts rolling wildly across the floor like a stubborn child seeking attention.
            “I can’t think of anything!” she cries dramatically while continuing to roll.
            Then Chloé speaks up – her voice surprisingly sharp and clear:
            “Then maybe... Rebecca, are you in love?”
            Louann stops moving instantly. She lies still, her back turned to Rebecca. It was the one question she had never wanted to hear – especially because she already knew the answer.
            And still... she would’ve given anything not to hear it from Chloé’s mouth.
            “No, I’m not in love,” Rebecca replies evenly.
            Even with her back turned, where Rebecca can’t see her face, Louann tries to force a smile. She knows her best friend is asexual and aromantic and that this answer was to be expected – but it still hurts. Her heart had wished for something else.
            “How boring. But I expected that. No one ever lives up to your high standards,” Chloé jokes.
            “Now spin the bottle, the next person gets a challenge.”
            “Maybe we should wrap it up for tonight,” Rebecca says, glancing at the drunk Luke, who’s trying to hide his skateboard under his shirt while struggling to stay balanced, and at Dana, who can barely keep her eyes open.
            “Oh come on, you guys can’t handle anything,” Chloé chuckles.
            “Okay, I’ll go find our two lovebirds outside and tell them we’re calling it a night.”
            She climbs out of the tree. Rebecca helps Luke and Dana into their beds and hands them both a glass of water. Louann slowly picks herself up and starts cleaning up the drinking game mess. Rebecca watches her once energetic friend now quietly tidying up the remaining beds, then turns her attention back to Luke, who’s reaching for a leftover shot nearby.
            Chloé returns and notices Louann’s visibly sad expression.
            “Chin up, Louann. We’ll see Juliana again soon. We’ve only got two more years at this academy, after all.”
            Louann snaps out of her thoughts and looks around until she spots Chloé.
            “Yeah... it’s just a shame. And they didn’t really play along either,” she says, trying to cover her embarrassment.
            “They’re closest to each other. Makes sense they’d want more time alone. Besides, tomorrow is important for their future,” Rebecca replies in a monotone voice.
            But after all the years they’ve spent together, the girls can tell she’s trying to lift their spirits.
            Then the three of them go to bed. </p>
        
            <p>“What... why... I mean... you’re only saying this now? You think I can’t take care of myself?” Tyler exclaims.
            “You think this is easy for me?” Juliana responds, shaken. “But this is all so new to me. You never said you wanted to break up, or that I was a burden, or...”
            “I didn’t see it that way,” Juliana cuts in. “You always tried your best, and our time together was beautiful.”
            “But... I can’t talk you out of this, can I?” Tyler asks, half-joking, but clearly hurt, eyes cast downward.
            “Then maybe we should say goodbye now. Because I won’t be at your graduation ceremony,” Tyler says bitterly.
            Juliana’s smile fades as she replies, “Don’t you want to say goodbye one last time? We might never see each other again.”
            “Who knows if we’ll even get the chance to talk at the ceremony. Better to say goodbye properly now,” Tyler says quietly.
            He’s deeply affected. He had hoped they’d find a way to stay together. That she’s ending things now hits him hard, and he just wants to get it over with. He knows her well enough to understand she won’t change her mind.
            Tyler walks Juliana to the tree, and as she starts to climb, she notices he’s not following.
            “You’re going back to your room, right?”
            “I’d feel weird lying next to the others... and you,” he confesses, eyes turned away.
            Juliana steps toward him, but almost instinctively, Tyler steps back. She reaches for him, gently guiding his face toward hers. Her eyes meet his with compassion, but he quickly looks away. She stands on her toes, closing the distance between them until their faces are just centimeters apart.
            Tyler squeezes his eyes shut. She just broke up with him, and now she’s kissing him again. He feels her soft lips, her hand gently on his cheek, the other slowly trailing from his chest to his neck. His tension melts, and for a moment, he wants to hold her and return the kiss.
            But then she pulls away and whispers seductively into his ear,
            “If you don’t want to go back to the others, we don’t have to. You said we should say goodbye properly. How about I come with you to your room?”
            He looks into her dark eyes, stars reflecting in them. She didn’t need to ask twice.
            He takes her hand, interlocking his fingers with hers. Together, they walk through the starlit night back to the school building.</p>
